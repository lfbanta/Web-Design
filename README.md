# Web-Design

One thing that I spent a lot of time doing was how my content collapsed on smaller screen sizes. With the way I formatted the images on the bigger screen sizes, just making one ranking on its own line looked weird. I remedied this by making two appear on the same line at once. Another thing that I wanted to focus on was the collapsing of the navbar. With the amount of items in the navbar, having them all on one line doesn't look right, so it took me a bit of work to make the navbar look good on all screen sizes. The images also caused a few problems to make look good, but weren't that hard to fix.
